LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: checked on other wallets. definitely looks like its just swapped on this wallet
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: its becuase of the bonuses
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: we sent your way
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: yeah but my current pp shows more than it actually is
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: how much more?
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: oh i see the difference
donut#6634ID#897725766098354186: <@445069262193950730> This looks correct to me? I sent you a 150k pp bounty last month, which doesn't get added to your earned pp (neither do transfers). 923 - 150 - transfers + order = 746
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: Hmmm so according to this much pp do I have available to spend ?
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: Is it 923 or 746?
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: Or is it 731 from the 2nd screenshot ?
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: I believe current pp is the amount you can spend
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: interest. okay. i was just not understanding what each meant. thanks all
