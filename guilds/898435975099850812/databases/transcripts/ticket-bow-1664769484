bow#4948ID#798383676051816478: From the market place for this order number:  4d92a9ff-fa17-4476-9837-bdc702caf7d6

Mini supers #2040 was sold a month ago in this order. bffad1a5-af73-4e9b-9a5a-b7bedd57b12a

and the same nft was place in the marketplace and I guess I tried to buy it again without realizing that seems to be a mistake.

May you refund me the pp :o?
donut#6634ID#897725766098354186: Yep, sorry about that <@798383676051816478> refund sent through
