IcebreakerJoe#3920ID#369245145587122176: Hey Flabb, we normally don't manually verify assets. This is so we do not have to constantly watch your wallet to see if you have sold or transferred your NFT. We have a very tight security system in here and I'll ping <@806699449334104114> to explain the details of it for you when he wakes up. I'll also let Bogan decide if we can manually verify you because I do not have the perms to do so. 

ultimately it is your choice to verify or not but I'll see what we can do for you if anything
Flabb#3389ID#142390753312636929: Yes ty for the fast reply and i understand, much appreciated. Im sorry for the hassle but ive seen a lot of scams/hack lately and i am super careful.
JØHNDAVIES.ETH#9648ID#277163918927986688: perfectly understandable in this space, sure a more senior member of the team will let you know
Flabb#3389ID#142390753312636929: ty guys <3!
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: unfortunately the only way to get your holder role would be to verify through collab.land since it checks your connected wallet periodically
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: if we gave you the role collab.land would just take it away
MXBØGAN#0647ID#806699449334104114: the reason why there's been a lot of scams/hacks is because people interact with fake bots
rest assured that this one is the legit bot
and like they said, if we give you the role manually, the bot will take it away from you

verify with the bot 
is 100% safe
no worries
Cam#1212ID#106540991493722112: For future reference you can add a note on the real collabland bot and say something like “real” so when you join a new server you can click on the bot and see the note is there and know its real <a:peepoclap:937255082175643678>
