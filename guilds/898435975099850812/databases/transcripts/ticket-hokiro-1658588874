Hokiro#5328ID#759615955981828127: Hello fam, I win Lucky Zeros WL from JPEG_Yakuza Twitter
Hokiro#5328ID#759615955981828127: I wanna claim the WL role, I'm not sure if the list has been sent to you or not
Hokiro#5328ID#759615955981828127: thankyou fam üòá üôè
J√òHNDAVIES.ETH#9648ID#277163918927986688: What giveaway was this for?
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: That whitelist is for a different project. JPEG_Yakuza was giving them away for a freemint project, not our project
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: It's not clear if that Jasper account is a scam or not, since he did not initiate the giveaway, but is listing winners
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: be careful, I would wait until JPEG_Yakuza announces the winners
