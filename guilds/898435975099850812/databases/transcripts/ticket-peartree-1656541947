LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: hello
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: I don't see your username in the export of submitted wallet addresses
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: strange it says I have the lucky designation
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: The whitelist is based on submitted wallets instead of a snapshot
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: so people can WL a wallet that doesn't necessarily have a lucky zero in it
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: we can add additional wallets to the WL when the mint slows down
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: wait why? so loyal holders like me are left out because we were busy
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: we have a lot of people that keep their NFTs in a cold wallet, but mint with a different one
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: so you can verify your holder role with that cold wallet, then mint with a hot wallet
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: hmmm okay, strange decision matrix, yes it helps those people, but not people like me
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: it also say "@Lucky Ø & @Legend Ø  (HOLDERS)
Mint window: June 29, 2022 3:00 PM (24 hour window)
Mints allowed: 3 for @Lucky Ø 
Mints allowed: 5 for @Legend Ø
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: holders not WL
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: so I dont know why I cant mint
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: all communications I can find said HOLDERS will get a mint chance
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: because your wallet wasn't submitted. We have been pinging people and collecting wallets for a few months
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: but we can still add you during this period
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: it's why we made it 24 hours
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: for people who missed the submit deadline
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: that would be greatly appreciated!
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: OK, need your wallet address
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: 0xC35483743c423e9101c3B435fD32d9E347B59A7D
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: got it
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: we'll make an announcement when the WL is updated
peartree#7470ID#276088525227819008: excellent!
