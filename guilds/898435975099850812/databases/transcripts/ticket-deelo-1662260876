DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: it's gotta be lowercase
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: How'd you get there? did you manually enter that URL in or was it from the profile link in the nav?
IcebreakerJoe#3920ID#369245145587122176: I copied pasted from wallet on metamask. That link used to work.
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: No worries, patching that now so they'll work again
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: you can see your points inside the cart panel and dashboard also <:diamondhands:991515220646301696>
