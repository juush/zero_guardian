Anthony||GMetrics#4845ID#897408567630508042: Hello, I'm Anthony from GMetrics
GMetrics a new start up, our team of developers are located in Tel-Aviv in Israel. We developed a community management software that will save you time and money managing your community. With Our software, you could eventually cut down about 75% of your community management administration costs and at least half of the time required to run the MCH community on discord.
Our dashboard connects social data with blockchain transactions giving the community manager an easy-to-read visualization of flippers, HODLers, Whales and blue-chip Nft holders this way you could monitor your Floor price and ensure it holds a strong muscle
Our Product also offers you a personalized community member experience. You will not have to deal with tons of irrelevant support tickets and will get notified when relevant members want to talk to you. You could also get to automate tasks like change roles, send airdrops and rewards send group DM and much more.
Again we are currently running a partnership program. The benefit of being our partner is that your community gets to use our platform for free and would only have to give us feedback.
We've made a demo video on our software, I'm sure you'll love it. Can I share it here?
