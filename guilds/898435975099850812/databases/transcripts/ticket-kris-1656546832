LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: that's your wallet?
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: It looks like you have a number of pending transactions
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: and the merkle proof on them looks correct
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: so the first one will go through, if you speed up gas or gas goes back to 26, which is the amount bid
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: I would cancel the others, only the first one will go through because you minted 3 with that one and that is the max allowed
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: the others will fail because it will be more than the amount allowed after the first one processes
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: They are just taking a long time because gas spiked from when you submitted, so right now you are underbid for gas
