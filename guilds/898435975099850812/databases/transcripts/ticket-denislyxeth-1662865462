denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: I also just transferred a whole bunch of Wøs between these 2 wallets today. Planning to retire the older wallet.
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: <@573133525059108864> just transferred those across for you
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Hi <@897725766098354186>! Will it take some time to reflect the transfer? I still see the original points via the Purebase website.
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: it should appear in your dashboard
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: it won't reflect in the profile page because that only takes into account the points you actually earn from holding
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Ohhh ok thanks! I will proceed to transfer out the rest of my Purebase NFTs now.
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Ohhh total earned, I get it now
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: <:pepesmile:940564050717339648>
DØNUT | LUCKY Ø#0410ID#897725766098354186: you're welcome! Experience vs available currency would be a better way to distinguish
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Oh the experience doesn't get transferred! Dang I was hoping to bump my my levels haha. Guess I have to restart
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Thanks Donut, we can close this ticket now
denislyx.eth#6532ID#573133525059108864: Have a good evening!
Lynx Guardian#2982ID#970760846294802452: We are creating a transcript, we will provide you with a ticket number shortly
