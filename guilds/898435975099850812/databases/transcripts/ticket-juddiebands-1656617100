LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: and then submit a new one with higher gas
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: that's all "speeding up" really does in metamask
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: it's just a UI thing
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: okay i hit cancel

Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: So u need to fix manually with nonce number
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Have u ever done that before?
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: nope never
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Ill try and find a guide online for ya
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: scroll down to method 2 custom nonce
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: this is after cancelling or before?
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: this will cancel that tx
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: by frontrunning it
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Oh ur fast
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Important is that the gas of the new tx is higher than that of the previous
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: actually, gas is  dropping
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: you might be OK
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: im too dumb for this, am i going to lose gas on all these cancellations?
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Yea just in case its stuck even as gas drops
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: wait it just confirmed
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: A little bit

LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: dropped it back to your initial bid
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: my brain cannot process what just happened hahaha
Eletran#3333ID#391314756734156801: Vitalik did something
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: you bid this much for gas
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: so gas price needed to drop back down into that range for your tx to process
Juddiebands#3333ID#760342083134685204: <:pepedent:985577728294158378>
