sup?
LamchopsYUM#9829ID#322241460617609216: Hellooo, so earlier there was a minting allocation issue where I only got 3 instead of 6 (legend + giveaway). Can I get 3 additional spots for next phase to make up for this? I was told Sonic was able to add more for people that had similar issues as soon as the minting started but I didn't find out until later.
MXBØGAN#0647ID#806699449334104114: hmmm
lemme check that with him
I'm sure it can be arranged
