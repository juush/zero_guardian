LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: minor thing on transfer pp prompt. it only lets me hit "confirm" if there is a comma in my amount entry. 

spent 10 minutes trying to figure out why i couldn't hit confirm only to find out it was the comma that was missing.
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: not sure if thats intentional but thought i'd put this out there in case not

LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: nvm the problem was not that. it was that 

The problem was that I was asking for "1926" to be transferred cause that's what the balance shows but it appears I had slightly less than "1926". 

As soon as i changed it to "1925" it worked no problem
