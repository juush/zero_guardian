Trag#7941ID#479786678274228234: Gm. We (Ether Royale) have built our own software that allows NFT collections to battle using their NFTs and specific metadata. Our bot ties the metadata to all killfeed messages so it’s custom to the specific traits. Example: if an nft has a katana then all kills by that NFT will include a katana. 

We have been testing and running battles within our collection for months and months. We are now reaching out to notable collections in hopes to custom build this for your collection. We came across your collection and would love see if this is a good fit for our wave 1 rollout coming up (currently 6/10 spots filled).

This battle bot is a great passive utility for holders. Battles can be for fun, nfts, a token you stake for  , partner whitelist spots and truly anything your creative minds desire.

We would love to custom build this for your collection. We can share some images or hop on a call to help you visualize everything.

*also cross battles are included where all of our partnerships will put up some NFTs for all of our holders to battle for*
