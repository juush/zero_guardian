797AT#0932ID#894003375430041621: Hey guys, I've been a long active member since the mint of lucky zeros for both purebase projects (legend role in their discord) and therefore i was able to mint a lot from the second gen collection of phase 1. I know phase 2 i coming along and therefore was interested in some wl spots for that.

I am now a collab manager for a project called Origo and I was wondering if 5 WL spots for phase 2 of lz x wøs project are available? The Origo project has probably the best 3D rendered art I've seen in the last year in the NFT space and maybe in the whole of the NFT space! It's a project with a really low supply of 333 NFTs with quality art and therefore I believe it has potential in standing out. I really thought that bringing quality NFT projects for collabs will make the project stand out, it will also help with the volume. 

The project had taken a big hit because they decided to mint out at the wrong time and they had this "tribulation" process they had for investors to avoid their investors experience a lower fp than their mint price which also affected the volume for the project and not be able to sell out despite having a strong product in art aspects. A small community of strong holders for this project are all trying to help out (including me) with this project through collabs and other ideas, I really hope you could make this collab work! :scheme: I know the team members take collabs a bit differently from other teams in the NFT space however I'm very sure that I can bring strong long term hodlers into this community and project as well!
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: we are holding phase II for a bit.
797AT#0932ID#894003375430041621: Yes, however I would be very appreciative of you getting WL spots for our project early, something like 5 spots would be sufficient for our Origo holders. I will update correctly within that discord as to when the phase II will occur. We understand your choice since the market is really in the gutter right now. However, we know Purebase will surely mint out their next few phases in the future, so we would like to be part of that long journey. We got rejected collabs with HTMKER already since apparently collabs are closed, I hope Purebase can show us some light <:cute:953257618208604160> for the future
CALV!N | LUCKY Ø#8888ID#879197800137633812: Yep if we do launch future phases i will let you know =]
LU!S | Ø#4085ID#445069262193950730: i'll be closing this <@894003375430041621> as it appears a phase II is not on the roadmap at this time. Please keep an eye out on socials and annoucnement in case anything changes. Hope holidays have treated you well!
