July#7485ID#870125882885406720: Hello team, have a great day!  I'm July from MadMen (links in my bio) and We would like to offer some free mint MadSlot NFT spots for your holders.

MadSlot NFT was powered by MadMen, a pass to join the MadSlot Impression Network. MadMen, a decentralized advertising platform focused on building a decentralized advertising network for the Web3 world. MadSlot Impression Network will help all contribute impressions to online advertisements to realize their value.

As a MadSlot NFT holder, you will have an NFT that can be constantly upgraded; access to View-to-Earn on MadMen; an NFT tied to your Web3 tag; eligibility to join the premium project whitelist lottery; eligibility to receive airdrops; exclusive event participation, and more.

I think it will be an added benefit for the community. Yes, an NFT that will earn ETH. It's worth mentioning that we will have a draw for holders after mint starts, yes, for all Mint users. The prize pool has now accumulated to 10 ETH, as well as NFTs and tokens from other projects, etc.

If you have advertising requirements, We can also provide free advertising on 721FM and TreasureLand.

Looking forward to your reply, we can discuss the details of the partnership and the specific spots and even the prize pool together.
