Zeta CM#2804ID#1004338732528312330: Hey, Britto here from Zeta! Are you interested in offering your community free access to an NFT bot?

Zeta is an exclusive NFT bot that can automatically mint any Ethereum NFTs. We’re looking for a small number of high quality partners to offer a free two week trial and thought Lucky Zero holders would be interested.

Unfortunately, we only have a small number of partnership spaces available as they’re in incredibly high demand. However, we’re fans of the Lucky Zero brand and I’m confident we could get an allocation for your holders.

I will leave a few links to our social platforms below:

Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: This would pose a security risk to our community and we also aren't open to collabs at the moment. Will close the ticket now and reach out if we decide to collab with you when this changes
Lynx Guardian#2982ID#970760846294802452: We are creating a transcript, we will provide you with a ticket number shortly
