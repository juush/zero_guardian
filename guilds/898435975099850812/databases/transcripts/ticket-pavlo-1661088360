pavlo#1804ID#950047848723005560: Hey, I submitted some music the other day (ticket id: 1660932688) and was wondering if you already have listened to it
IcebreakerJoe#3920ID#369245145587122176: Hey Pavlo. We had listened to your music and we thought it was very good. Unfortunately, With our partnership with Wild ones studio we are not really in need of any services that involve music becuase they can provide us with that. Again, we greatly appreciate the time you took to make that and if we do ever come across a time where we need people to make music we will make it known and you can submit another ticket or form then. Thank you Pavlo! Best of luck ❤️
pavlo#1804ID#950047848723005560: Alright, nevertheless, thank you!
bigstank#4085ID#445069262193950730: Wishin you the best!
