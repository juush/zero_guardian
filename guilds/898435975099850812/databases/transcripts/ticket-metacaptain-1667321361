My name is John, I am the project manager for Metacom Space and we recently just expanded our venue for our very first Metacomference (A Networking Event Inside Our Own Metaverse). I came across your incredible project and I have something cool to bring to you and your community!

We would like to offer you a free booth to showcase your project and network amongst the 100+ NFT Projects attending. This could be a great way to network, find similar projects and collab or just grow your following with the many guests that we'd have in attendance.

I also have pictures of our actual venue. We will have DJ's playing, a fashion runway, 100+ Booths being showcased aswell as speakers from top projects talking about web 3. All accessible via mobile,pc or oculus
