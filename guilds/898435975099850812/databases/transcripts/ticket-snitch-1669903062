I‚Äôve been following Lucky Zeros | Purebase NFT closely and I‚Äôm amazed by the community!
My name is Arsenii, CEO of Snitch.
To make it short, we build the world's first digital necklaces that authenticate and display NFTs.
‚Ä¶new use case of NFTs for people
‚Ä¶turns the NFT into a fashion accessory
‚Ä¶helps community members find each other during events
Want to offer a $2-3M collab with Lucky Zeros | Purebase NFT. Can I share more?
Thanks, Arsenii
LU!S | √ò#4085ID#445069262193950730: Hi <@988495791406596147> thanks for reaching out! Curious as to what you found amazing about our community? I gotta agree with you they are a beauty (I may be bias).

Do you have a twitter handle we can learn more about you or about Snitch?
SNITCH#7713ID#988495791406596147: Haha, Luis. You are not bias!üòÅ 

Basically, Snitch is a real-world hardware fashion accessory. It connects the user's wallet through our web application and displays NFTs in real life. Imagine if billions of NFTs art could become a part of your outfit. Nobody has ever done it before. We've spent 8 months on development and engineering. 

For Lucky Zeros, we have this collaboration concept in mind:

Revenue-share exclusive drop. We could produce particular amount of exclusive and limited devices with your branding, and make digital twins (NFT). Azuki recently made $2,5 M on the limited edition of skateboards. We could do something similar here.

<@445069262193950730>, could you please send your email so I can share a presentation with details as well as links to our social media? So you will see what it looks like.
SNITCH#7713ID#988495791406596147: Almost forgot. Here is how the device will look like. The real prototype will be finished in 2 weeks.
SNITCH#7713ID#988495791406596147: Oh, I just realized I can't attach images here. Let me know how it would be comfortable to send some pics of the product to you.
SNITCH#7713ID#988495791406596147: Hi, Lucky Zeros Team. I can't wait to send more info on email! 

If you are not interested - no worries. If you would like to explore more about the project and our plans, feel free to reply. We‚Äôll be happy to answer any of your questions.

Cheers.
LU!S | √ò#4085ID#445069262193950730: Gm! After discussing with the team internal we have decided to not pursue this as we focus on partnerships we have on hand and on the horizon. We do appreciate you reaching out and will be sure to reach out if we decide we want to pursue. Wishing you the best! Thanks again
