cryptoguy#5164ID#971078811926011916: Hello team
I'm martins Dave and am the founder of MDG community engagement and management organization.

And have gone through your project and see you've got good potential in the market and will be doing real great.
But there's one valuable resources I've noticed your community is lacking and that's community engagement, and these helps attract Investors and attracting investors is far better than searching for them,and it's been proven that a successful project is one that focuses more on community and I believe the team are making good decisions towards this but are still not getting it right, so I've brought to you the best solution for this.
would you love to know about this?

cryptoguy#5164ID#971078811926011916: How about community engagement
cryptoguy#5164ID#971078811926011916: I don't really much of that happening here
cryptoguy#5164ID#971078811926011916: Could get that covered up by my team
IcebreakerJoe#3920ID#369245145587122176: No need for artificial engagement. Core community is here alive and well. Clearly you haven’t been here too long if you don’t see that
