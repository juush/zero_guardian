ReDeFined#0456ID#736601983653249105: **Rumblerz Fight Club**
Our project and system is a little different. We've got zero paid shillers and we've been silently gaming this out for the last 5 months.
We're a claymation/stop motion tv show that thrives on community involvement. Selecting winners or losers isn't our game. "Whether you're a bluechip or a rug, the punches land the same"

TL;DR of our project is: 
We have an LA based creative team who is making a stop motion clay fight show featuring the PFP's people already own.
Layer 1 Utility is entertainment and laughter: entertainment unites people and currently the web3 space has very little UNITING entertainment out there! 
Layer 2 Utility is governance: By being a show for and by the people it levels the playing field and allows involvement. The lack of equal representation is what is siloing the space atm.
Layer 3 is Royalties: Our holders get 50% of all profits from the television show as well as secondary sales. 

All we ask is that you send your communities to us. This is where we're different. We aren't pfp competition. They won’t come to us and never return to your community and we aren't here to dilute their $ either. They come to us as representatives from your community and by participating with us they guarantee your projects a place in our show. It costs your holders nothing, and it costs your project nothing to get them put into our show. The fun bonus is we are the Web3 “robinhoods”. We're leveraging traditional Web2 advertising dollars and giving them back to the web3 space. It is hard to break through in the current environment and people don't trust each other right now. This is why we rely on your support.
