Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: I purchased one of the stolen LZ's. I would like to get back in contact with the guy who lost them so I can return it to him.
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: Thanks for reaching out Anthony
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: Ethoran, the member who lost the NFTs, is in a different timezone
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: Another option is you send the NFT to the project dev wallet (0x99d6ED5E57F75f82956ef1FC7EF26A6dC24303f6)
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: and then I will send you 0.13ETH, which I think is what you paid
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: if the amount is incorrect let me know
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: stepping away for a big, afk for about 40 minutes

Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: Need to take a shower back in 20
Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: I  just need some help to know how to send it to the dev wallet
Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: Sorry im so new to this
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: no worries
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: when you are logged into opensea, if you go to the individual page for that NFT, you should see a screen like this
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: click on that arrow I circled
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: and it will ask you what address you want to transfer it to
Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: ok found it
Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: so copy and paste your dev wallet in the address bar yes?

Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: Sure if you are happy to do that
Anthony*#8488ID#267017943886462995: It was more about the right thing getting the NFT back to the owner for me
LuckySonic#2581ID#887189746844065793: OK, 0.13 sent
