Stance#5793ID#691758956196003870: Hey Groovyfrens ðŸ¤© stance here! First off super excited about the server opening excited to see more!! I am opening a ticket to apply for a moderating and or collab team position or both haha! I have experience in both positions as I am a moderator for @TheAwakenedNFT, @KikiVerseNFT, and @LucidNFT_ as well as part of the collab team for lucid !! I feel confident with the experience that I have and would be more than happy to extend this forward to the Groovyverse!! ðŸ•º I am in New York City so my time zone is EST! looking forward to hearing back! I was also going to attach a Twitter dm for reference but it wonâ€™t let me haha!! But I felt reaching out in the server would be best!
SiahTheSamoan#5767ID#239659529707454464: Hey Stance! I currently head up the moderation team and for right now we're not looking for moderators but my man <@269455667968868353> looks after collaboration outreach, he'll be in contact soon.
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Hi Stance! Thank you for the ticket! I will have a quick chat with the team. At the moment, we don't have any available moderating spots, however we may have 1 or 2 left for the collab team position who are the <@&1010377635542610021>.
