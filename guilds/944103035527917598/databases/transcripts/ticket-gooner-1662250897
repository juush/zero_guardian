VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Hi I will just check with their Collab manager to see if he has distributed the unique codes to the winners. The codes are used to claim the WL role and register your wallet to the contract.
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Hi Gooner, the collab manager is currently getting me the list of Discord IDs for me and we will hand our WL roles after. For now just submit your wallet in <#1010724441606594620>
gooner#8733ID#489648349105094656: Thank you!!
gooner#8733ID#489648349105094656: Done
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Awesome thanks goner. I’ll chase up again on the Discord IDs but I’ll just give you a Groovy List for now. Welcome to the GroovyVerse!
