pau.la#3405ID#943282171102257172: Good day, I would like to express my intentions in applying for a moderator Job as well as to support this project and my friend Asch who is one of the artist here. I would love to plan and host some events for the community. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: Hey paula! At this time we don't have any moderator positions available, but this is likely to change as we grow! I will let <@239659529707454464> see this so he can take down your name and reach out if a position opens up <:peeposmile:936835023141736448>
SiahTheSamoan#5767ID#239659529707454464: Absolutely awesome to hear from you! However Juuce was right in we have no positions in moderation roles available, this will not be permanent and in our growth roles will become available further down the track.

When looking to fill these roles we will be looking for people in our community who are actively engaged and willing to have fun with each other! We strongly encourage you to still organize events or games and you have my promise I'll try be there whenever I can!
pau.la#3405ID#943282171102257172: Thank you üòä will do
SiahTheSamoan#5767ID#239659529707454464: If there‚Äôs nothing else I‚Äôll go ahead and close this ticket ‚ò∫Ô∏è
ZER√ò Guardian#2982ID#970760846294802452: We are creating a transcript, we will provide you with a ticket number shortly
