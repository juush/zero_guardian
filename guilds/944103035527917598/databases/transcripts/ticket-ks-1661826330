.Ks#5587ID#715737566883741716: Hello there. I'm the collab manager and mod for Metrograd NFT community and I'm here for potential collab on your project. We currently have 77k followers in Twitter (as per typing) and 10k discord members. For our background, Metrograd is a 333 post-apocalypse-themed, utility based, pixel-art, genesis collection. Our community and genesis collection holders have took an interest and asked the team if we could do collab with your project. I hope you could consider our proposal. Thank you so much!

VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Do you guys use alphabot at all?
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: And did you want to do a cross collab, trade WL for WL?
.Ks#5587ID#715737566883741716: Yess we use alpha bot for giveaway
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Awesome! Let's go ahead with 25 WL spots here, we were hoping that we could get some WL spots for Gen 2 if possible as well. 25 Gen 2 WL spots.
.Ks#5587ID#715737566883741716: The team isn't handling out WL spots for now. Is that okay with you?
