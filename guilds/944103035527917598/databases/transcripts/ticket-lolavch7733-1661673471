lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Hi
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: I want to talk about some incident that happened yesterday. I'm mod at LazyThings. And we noticed that groovy mega man was a good ppl person.  So we offered him a job. And he accepted. He was supposed to start this morning. But strange stuff started to happen. First he blocked me on Twitter and discord. Then did the same wth our founder.
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: 
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: We had someone trying to hack us...
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Just want to warn you guys to be careful.
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: 
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: If you don't want the job you just say...
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: But why block Every social
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Just be careful guys!
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: ‚ù§Ô∏è Lola
tommyGM#5257ID#700898335602769920: Hey Lola! Thanks for this we'll keep an eye out to see what's going on üôÇ
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Oke... Great. He could have just said no...now I still see him in the general. How awkward.
tommyGM#5257ID#700898335602769920: Hey lola, just want to say I really appreciate you looking out for our community. For now we'll have him on a watchlist üôÇ It's very odd to me still so I don't want to make any conclusion, but thank you for updating me on the current circumstance üôÇ
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Yes it was very odd to us too. Because he accepted the offer to start in our server this morning. We never pay our mods.. Only free mint. But the founder was willing to make an exception and pay it out of his own pocket. Just to hype the chat up. A server as big. 29000 now. We have too many ppl comming in to have a really community like here. Mods are there to guide ppl. He was supposed to be like a joker to spice it up. Jump Arround. And then wtf happend ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: dang I'm sorry to hear that :/ thabks for letting us know <@468519096867225610>

lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: You never block someone accidentally and he blocked me and the founder on Twitter too
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: 
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Be very careful
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Like my founder says  if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck....
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: hey, I like ducks :(
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Haha me too
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: I really liked him...that's the sad thing. We offered a free mint...he says yes. Comes in the server. Jumped Arround for an hour and impresses. Leaves and asked 150$ a week. Then 200.
Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: can you link his twitter
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: He comes to an agreement wth then founder

Juuce#0001ID#98271549726945280: what makes you say it was ddos
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: The founder says the twitter rep says the twitter account got a ddos attack
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: I don't know any details...
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Just be careful guys. Do what you want with this information
SiahTheSamoan#5767ID#239659529707454464: What does he mean by twitter rep? It‚Äôs strange as ddos attacks aren‚Äôt directed at particular social media accounts it‚Äôs a internet attack
lolavch7733#8974ID#468519096867225610: Twitter representative. The guy who 's in charge of the twitter account I guess.
