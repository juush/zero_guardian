billybob420#1455ID#290950377564667904: Hi team! I won the Nexus Tool WL GA 🙂 am i supposed to send my wallet over here?
SiahTheSamoan#5767ID#239659529707454464: Hey billy! You should have been provided a code from the nexus team, if you haven’t flick them a message and then get back to us ❤️
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Hey <@290950377564667904>, just follow the instructions found in <#999139772696113242>. Submit you wallet address via <#1010724441606594620> so that we can send off your wallets to Nexus Tools.
billybob420#1455ID#290950377564667904: Alright thankyou <@239659529707454464> <@269455667968868353>
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Siah might have confused you for another person receiving a Groovy Frens WL. His instructions describe how to receive our GroovyList spots if you won that. 

If you are asking about how to receive your Nexus Tools WL instead, then just follow my instructions 🙂
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: Any questions just open up another ticket
VinNFTs#9999ID#269455667968868353: I'll close this ticket in an hour 🙂
