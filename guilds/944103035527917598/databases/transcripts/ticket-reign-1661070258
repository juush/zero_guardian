reign#2476ID#143992000268599297: Yo!   I‚Äôm the community manager for Nine Lives Battalion.   We are a hand drawn  project with the artist based in Nz along with a majority of the team, then a few of us in Aus.    We have minted our genesis collection of 999 which minted out at early into the market crash.   We have our next collection of 6000 preparing to launch.   

Currently our genesis holders are staking their nfts and earning our erc20 token chow.    Which can be used to buy things in the chow store, currently had some cyberkongz vx, jiraverse and ducky keyboards in there.   The major thing will be being able to buy contracts to access the mining site.   The owner of the project owns 3 BTC mining facilities.  All rather large.  Every so often ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù will go up in the store and if people are quick enough will get to buy hashing power for the mining site and use it to passively receive BTC at intervals.
reign#2476ID#143992000268599297: Unfortunately due to a family tragedy things are a little quiet as the boss man lost his father and fathers wife to sickness in the UK so he‚Äôs currently dealing with that.  But once he‚Äôs back on board we will be starting up our marketing campaign for the next mint and re launching the store/mining site.   Also praying btc starts going up again üòÇ
